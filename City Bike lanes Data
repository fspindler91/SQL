--In this project I used a window function to distinguish between bike lanes that need improvemenbts and those that need to be left alone or removed.

--Bike lanes with an average safety rating of 4 or more should be labeled "Leave As-Is".
--Bike lanes with an average safety rating of less than 2.5 should be labeled as "Remove".
--All other bike lanes should be labeled as "Improvements Needed".

SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating",
CASE
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating)OVER (PARTITION BY safetyrating) >= 4 THEN 'Leave As-Is'
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY safetyrating) < 2.5 THEN 'Remove'
    ELSE 'Improvements Needed'
    END AS 'Recommendation'
